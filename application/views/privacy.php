								Effective Date: Dec 5, 2016

								At Yiyalo, we believe that you have a right to know what information we collect from you, and we want you to understand our commitment to protecting your privacy. (Because we take your privacy very seriously!) We’ve created this Privacy Policy to let you know what to expect when you interact with us. To keep things simple, we stick to this Privacy Policy no matter which website features you use or access.

								By using our Services, you agree to the use, disclosure and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites (“Third Party Services”), such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Google+, that we do not own or control, even if you access them through the Services. We try to only work with Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, but we cannot take responsibility for their practices, content, or privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access so that you know how they will use and share your information.

								<h3 >1. What Information does Yiyalo Collect?</h3>

								The information we collect from you falls into two categories: personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and non-personally identifiable information (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify who you are) (“Non-Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy covers both types and will tell you how we might collect and use each.

								Personal Information we may collect from you includes:

								•	your name, username, email address, and password

								•	information from Third Party Services that you explicitly give us access to

								•	your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle, or email (depending on how you contact us)

								•	survey responses to the extent you include Personal Information

								We may also collect some of the following Non-Personal Information from you:

								•	the name of your internet service provider

								•	the IP address of the computer you use to access our Services

								•	the type of browser software you are using

								•	the operating system you are using

								•	the date and time you access our Services

								•	the website address, if any, that linked you to our Site

								•	the website address, if any, you leave our website and travel to

								•	your home page customization preferences

								•	search engine search terms and advertising clicks/actions

								•	weblogs and other clickstream data

								•	survey responses to the extent you do not include Personal Information

								•	in-store and near-store mobile device wireless signature information (such as a MAC address), which we use solely on an anonymous basis, as described below

								•	other non-personally identifiable traffic data

								<h3 >2. How We Collect Information</h3>

								We may collect your information in the following ways:

								When You Provide Us With Information to Make a Booking

								 If you use our platform to make a booking, we may request certain Personal Information from you to facilitate the transaction. This may include (i) contact information such as your name, email address, and shipping address, and (ii) prescription information, including any images of prescriptions you may provide to us. We, or companies that provide services on our behalf, may also collect certain financial information from you, such as your payment method (this may include valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We store only a very limited portion of your credit card information, in a manner that is generally permitted by credit card issuers. Our payment processor, that credit card issuers require to have sufficient security, stores and processes your credit card or other payment information using industry-standard security measures. By making a purchase through the Services, you give us consent to use and provide your financial information as we consider necessary to process the transaction.

								Communications You Initiate with Us

								We do everything possible to make sure you have an amazing shopping experience. If you contact us in person, by phone, email, instant message, social media, or by some other means (either through our Services or through Third Party Services), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence for later reference (to help improve our service!). When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to figure out how to deliver more delightful and helpful emails and improve our Services.



								Information We Automatically Collect

								Cookies are small files that web servers may place on your computer when you visit a website. You may be able to set your web browser to reject cookies entirely or require that it request permission from you before accepting each new cookie. You can also delete cookies from your hard drive once you leave a website. We may also collect information when you are visiting our stores. 

								<h3 >3. How We Use the Information We Gather</h3>

								We primarily use the information we collect and store to enhance the Services and your experience with Yiyalo. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, as described below, we do not rent or sell your Personal Information to anyone, period. If we share your Personal Information, we do so only as described below.

								Internal Use to Provide Services to You

								We may use Personal Information to provide the Services to you. Some ways we may internally use your information include:

								•	to contact you when necessary

								•	to respond to your comments or questions

								•	to provide you with additional information according to your preferences

								•	to customize and personalize your experience with the Services

								•	to generate anonymous statistics to help us improve the customer experience

								

								Except as we discuss in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties who wish to market other products and services to you. 

								We never want to cause you any hassles!

								Business Transfers

								We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.



								Protection of Us and Others

								We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; cooperate with law enforcement; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Yiyalo, our employees, our users, or others.

								With Your Consent

								Except as we’ve stated above, we will notify you before we share your Personal Information with any third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

								<h3 >4. We are Committed to Making Sure Your Information is Protected</h3>

								We take the protection of your information very seriously. We understand the sensitivity of (for example) the prescription information you may give us. Therefore, we take many security measures (physical, electronic and procedural) to help keep your Personal Information safe. For example, we limit access to authorized employees and third parties who have agreed to follow confidentiality obligations we give them. Also, we only allow parties to access your Personal Information for permitted business purposes. Unfortunately, even though we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee complete security. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.

								<h3 >5. We Reserve the Right to Update and Revise this Privacy Policy at Any Time</h3>

								We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable law and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms. Your use of our Services constitutes your acceptance of the terms of the Privacy Policy as amended or revised by us from time to time.



								<h3 >6. What Personal Information can I access?</h3>

								Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:

								•	name and password

								•	mailing address

								•	billing address

								•	email address
